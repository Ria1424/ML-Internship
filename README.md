# ML Internship- Projects

<h3> <b> Task 1: Customer Churn Prediction </b></h3>
<p> <b> Objective </b>: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. Use historical
customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like
Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn. <br> 
<b>Dataset </b>: It is the dataset of a U.S. bank customer for getting the information that , this particular customer will leave
bank or not. </p> <br>

<h3> <b> Task 2: Credit Card Fraud detection </b></h3>
<p> <b> Objective </b>: Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit
card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random
Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. <br>
<b> Dataset </b>:It is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the
duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a
pool of 800 merchants. </p> <br>

<h3> <b> Task 3: Movie Genre Classification </b></h3>
<p> <b> Objective </b>: Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual
information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, or Support Vector Machines. <br>
<b> Dataset </b>: IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television
programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal
biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. An additional fan feature, message boards,
was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is now owned and operated by
IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon. As of December 2020, IMDb has approximately 7.5 million titles (including
episodes) and 10.4 million personalities in its database,[2] as well as 83 million registered users.
IMDb began as a movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993. </p> <br>

<h3> <b> Task 4: Credit Card Fraud detection </b></h3>
<p> <b> Objective </b>: Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word
embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam
messages. <br>
<b> Dataset </b>: The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It
contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam. </p> <br>
